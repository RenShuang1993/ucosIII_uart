 *
 * @note (1) CPU_TS_TmrInit() is an application/BSP function that MUST be
 *           defined by the developer if either of the following CPU features
 *           is enabled:
 *           (a) CPU timestamps
 *           (b) CPU interrupts disabled time measurements
 *           See also cpu_cfg.h
 *       (2) (a) Timer count values MUST be returned via word-size-configurable
 *               CPU_TS_TMR data type.
 *               - If timer has more bits, truncate timer values' higher-order
 *                 bits greater than the configured CPU_TS_TMR timestamp timer
 *                 data type word size.
 *               - Since the timer MUST NOT have less bits than the configured
 *                 CPU_TS_TMR timestamp timer data type word size;
 *                 CPU_CFG_TS_TMR_SIZE MUST be configured so that ALL bits in
 *                 CPU_TS_TMR data type are significant.
 *
 *                 In other words, if timer size is not a binary-multiple of
 *                 8-bit octets (e.g., 20-bits or even 24-bits), then the next
 *                 lower, binary-multiple octet word size SHOULD be configured
 *                 (e.g., to 16-bits). However, the minimum supported word size
 *                 for CPU timestamp timers is 8-bits.
 *
 *               See also cpu_cfg.h and cpu_core.h
 *
 *          (b) Timer SHOULD be an 'up'  counter whose values increase with each
 *              time count.
 *
 *          (c) When applicable, timer period SHOULD be less than the typical
 *              measured time but MUST be less than the maximum measured time;
 *              otherwise, timer resolution inadequate to measure desired times.
